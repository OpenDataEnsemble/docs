# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about ODE installation, usage, and development.

## General Questions

### How do you pronounce ODE?

ODE is pronounced like "code", without the "C."

### What is ODE?

Open Data Ensemble (ODE) is a platform for mobile data collection and synchronization. It provides tools for creating forms, collecting data offline, and synchronizing data across devices and servers.

### Is ODE free to use?

Yes, ODE is open source and free to use. The code is available under the MIT license.

### What platforms does ODE support?

ODE supports Android and iOS mobile devices. The server component runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Do I need internet connectivity to use ODE?

No, ODE is designed to work offline. Data is stored locally and synchronized when connectivity is available.

## Installation Questions

### What are the system requirements?

See the [Prerequisites](/getting-started/installation/prerequisites) page for detailed system requirements.

### Can I run ODE in the cloud?

Yes, ODE can be deployed to cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. See the [Deployment guide](/guides/deployment/production) for details.

### Do I need a database?

Yes, ODE requires PostgreSQL for data storage. The database schema is created automatically on first run.

## Usage Questions

### How do I create forms?

Forms are defined using JSON schema. See the [Form Design guide](/guides/forms/overview) for details.

### Can I customize the user interface?

Yes, ODE supports custom applications and renderers. See [Custom Applications](/guides/custom-apps/overview) for details.

### How does synchronization work?

ODE uses a bidirectional sync protocol that pushes local data to the server and pulls new data from the server. See [Synchronization](/using/synchronization) for details.

### What happens if two devices modify the same data?

ODE automatically resolves conflicts using a version-based approach. The most recent version takes precedence.

## Development Questions

### How do I contribute to ODE?

See the [Contributing guide](/development/contributing/guide) for information on how to contribute.

### Can I extend ODE functionality?

Yes, ODE is designed to be extensible. See [Extending ODE](/development/extending/overview) for details.

### What programming languages are used?

ODE uses React Native for mobile apps, React for web components, and Go for the server.

## Troubleshooting

### The app won't connect to the server

- Verify the server is running and accessible
- Check the server URL in app settings
- Verify firewall and network settings
- For Android emulator, use `10.0.2.2` instead of `localhost`

### Forms are not appearing

- Verify forms were uploaded to the server
- Check that the app has synchronized
- Review server logs for errors

### Data is not synchronizing

- Check network connectivity
- Verify authentication credentials
- Review server logs for sync errors
- Ensure observations were saved locally

### Build errors

- Ensure all prerequisites are installed
- Check that dependencies are up to date
- Review error messages for specific issues
- See component-specific documentation for build instructions
