# Why ODE?

ODE provides several advantages over traditional data collection solutions, particularly for organizations working in challenging environments with unreliable connectivity.

## Advantages

### Offline-First Architecture

Unlike many data collection platforms that require constant connectivity, ODE is designed to work offline. Data is stored locally and synchronized when connectivity is available, ensuring that field work is never interrupted by network issues.

### Conflict Resolution

When multiple devices modify the same data, ODE automatically resolves conflicts using a version-based approach. This ensures data integrity without requiring manual intervention.

### Flexible Form Design

The JSON-based form system allows for complex validation rules, conditional logic, and custom question types. Forms can be updated without requiring application updates, enabling rapid iteration and adaptation.

### Open Source

ODE is fully open source, allowing organizations to audit the code, customize the platform, and contribute improvements. This transparency builds trust and enables community-driven development.

### Cross-Platform Support

Applications built with ODE run on both Android and iOS devices, reducing the need to maintain separate codebases for different platforms.

### Extensible

The platform supports custom applications and renderers, allowing organizations to create specialized workflows and user interfaces that match their specific needs.

## Comparison with Alternatives

| Feature | ODE | Traditional Solutions |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| Offline Support | Full offline functionality | Limited or none |
| Conflict Resolution | Automatic | Manual or none |
| Form Updates | Without app updates | Requires app updates |
| Customization | High flexibility | Limited |
| Open Source | Yes | Often proprietary |
| Cost | Free and open source | Licensing fees |

## When to Use ODE

ODE is particularly well-suited for:

- Organizations conducting field research or data collection in remote areas
- Projects requiring complex forms with validation and conditional logic
- Teams needing to customize the user experience
- Organizations prioritizing data privacy and security
- Projects requiring offline functionality

## When to Consider Alternatives

ODE may not be the best fit if:

- Your use case requires real-time collaboration features
- You need extensive third-party integrations out of the box
- Your team lacks technical resources for deployment and maintenance
- Your data collection needs are very simple and don't require offline support
